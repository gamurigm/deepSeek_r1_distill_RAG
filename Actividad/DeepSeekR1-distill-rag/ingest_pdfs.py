PDF Document Ingestion Script for DeepSeek R1 Distill RAG System

This module handles the preprocessing and ingestion of PDF documents into a vector
database for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system. It performs the
following key operations:

1. **Document Loading**: Recursively loads all PDF files from the data directory
2. **Text Splitting**: Breaks documents into manageable chunks with overlap
3. **Embedding Generation**: Converts text chunks into vector embeddings
4. **Vector Store Creation**: Stores embeddings in ChromaDB for fast similarity search

The resulting vector database enables semantic search over document content,
allowing the RAG system to retrieve relevant context for user queries.

Technical Details:
- Uses LangChain for document processing pipeline
- HuggingFace sentence-transformers for embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2)
- ChromaDB as the vector database backend
- Configurable chunk size and overlap for optimal retrieval

Author: AI-CIS Project
Dependencies: langchain, chromadb, sentence-transformers, PyPDF2

    Load all PDF files from a directory and split them into text chunks.
    
    This function performs the first stage of the document ingestion pipeline:
    1. Recursively searches for PDF files in the specified directory
    2. Loads and extracts text content from each PDF
    3. Splits the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks
    
    The chunking strategy uses recursive character splitting with overlap to:
    - Ensure chunks fit within model context windows
    - Maintain semantic coherence across chunk boundaries
    - Provide context overlap for better retrieval accuracy
